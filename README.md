# Kickstarter-analysis
Overview of Project:
The purpose of this analysis is to help Louise figure out the best time to launch her campaign . the best time of the year to launch the campaign the 2nd quarter of the year April through June.
Looking at the data that has been analyzed including the percentage funded for each campaign ; the best campaign that can be profitable in term of fundraising is the Theatre campaign/,plays subcategory.
	The Theatre /Plays campaign shows a trend line of 33% failed vs 67% success rate in overall category goals.
	The Theatre /Plays campaign shows 0 campaigns that has been canceled
	In the analysis of the outcome based on goals between 1000 to 5000 the number of fundraisers are high vs the maximum figures ex (45000) which indicates that the campaign is having multiple numbers of fundraises in lowest figures resulting in continuity of the fundraising. this is reflecting in the visualization attached.

Challenges:
Some of the data was unreadable and had to be converted.
Some of the formulas that was used to complete this analysis, have not been discussed in the class as excel has so many different formulas and it wonâ€™t be all covered however the hints were very useful especially that it gives different scenarios using those formulas.

Limitations:
Some of the limitations I found that I had to repeat the same coding for several cells in the same table.
Some of the limitations is how accurate the analysis and if there are any errors
Other graphics and tables that could have been created:
Some of the tables that could have been created are statistical graphics based on a specific country or tables and graphics based on pledge instead of the goal , also tables and graphics based on donations.
Different graphics and tables can be created from this data according to what we would like to visualize, for example at some point Louis was interested to visualize 5 plays and she wanted to know if those 5 plays were funded.
